## Step 3: Use Visual Clues to Confirm the Level

### Mild Acne

- Little redness  
- Usually in one small area  
- No deep or painful lumps

- Noticeable redness  
- Pimples appear in groups  
- Pus-filled spots are common  
- Still mostly surface-level  

### Moderate–Severe Acne
- Skin looks painful and irritated  
- Redness spreads between pimples  
- At least one deep lump (no visible head)  
- Most of the face affected  

### Severe Acne
- Large, deep, purple-red lumps  
- Skin texture looks uneven or damaged  
- Scars may be visible  
- Face, chest, and back may all be involved  
- Multiple deep lumps may connect together
